				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>HSL</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is). Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: hsl(200, 20%, 50%).</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Percentages are commonly used to size box-model features, like the width, height, padding, or margin of an element.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>When percentages are used to size width and height, child elements will be sized relative to the dimensions of their parent (remember that parent dimensions must first be set).</td>

					<th class='cattag'>Media Queries</th>
				</tr>

				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>Media features can detect many aspects of a user’s browser, including the screen’s width, height, resolution, orientation, and more.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The and operator requires multiple media features to be true at once.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>A comma separated list of media features only requires one media feature to be true for the code within to be applied.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The best practice for identifying where media queries should be set is by resizing the browser to determine where the content naturally breaks. Natural breakpoints are found by resizing the browser.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class='cattag'>Flexbox</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class='attribute'>display: flex</span> changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.</td>
